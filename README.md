# 🧩 C++ Static Binary Analysis Framework  
A modular C++ framework for static analysis of binary executables (PE/ELF).  
This tool extracts metadata, parses sections, analyzes imports/exports, detects suspicious patterns, and assists in malware analysis & reverse engineering.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Parse PE (Windows) executables  
✔ Parse ELF (Linux) binaries  
✔ Extract headers, sections, imports, exports  
✔ Detect packing or obfuscation indicators  
✔ Analyze symbol tables  
✔ Identify suspicious API calls  
✔ Print human-readable analysis reports  
✔ Modular architecture for extensions
